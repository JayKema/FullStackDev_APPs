    "Fyyur\n",
    "Fyyur is an application where musical artists can meet musical venues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Artists and venues can visit this site in order to post information about themselves as well as find each other.\n",
    "This site lists information about different venues across different cities, as well as different artists that exist.\n",
    "From here, you can also discover shows where different artists are playing at different venues.\n",
    "On this site, you have a chance to post a venue and list a new venue if that venue hasn't yet been listed, you could do the same thing with artists as well as shows, you can also find artists and venues.\n",
    "For a particular artist, you can view information about their genre, contact information, whether or not they are currently seeking talent, as well as information about their upcoming and past shows.\n",
    "There's also information about artists here who are also seeking performance venues to play at, as well as information about their upcoming and past shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, this app works perfectly with mock data, and we'd like the app to work perfectly as well when we connect it to a real relational database using real data. We'd like to use SQLAlchemy all run throughout, and have this connect to a Postgres database.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend working in the provided classroom workspaces; however, there's additional guidance on this project listed in the README which will give you instructions on how to start and run the local development server, as well as generally what to look for, what the acceptance criteria of this project is, as well as how to create a stand-out submission that implements more than what we asked for.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find all of the starter code for this project in the Project Workspace. If you choose to work locally, this information may also be found at this GitHub repository.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fyyur Project Details\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to build out the data models to power the API endpoints for the Fyyur site by connecting to a PostgreSQL database for storing, querying, and creating information about artists and venues on Fyyur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "This app is nearly complete. It is only missing one thing… real data! While the views and controllers are defined in this application, it is missing models and model interactions to be able to store retrieve, and update data from a database. By the end of this project, you should have a fully functioning site that is at least capable of doing the following, if not more, using a PostgreSQL database:\n",
    "\n",
    "creating new venues, artists, and creating new shows.\n",
    "searching for venues and artists.\n",
    "learning more about a specific artist or venue.\n",
    "We want Fyyur to be the next new platform that artists and musical venues can use to find each other, and discover new music shows. Let's make that happen!\n",
    "\n",
    "Tech Stack (Dependencies)\n",
    "1. Backend Dependencies\n",
    "Our tech stack will include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment provided in the workspace (if working locally, see README)\n",
    "SQLAlchemy ORM to be our ORM library of choice\n",
    "PostgreSQL as our database of choice\n",
    "Python3 and Flask as our server language and server framework\n",
    "Flask-Migrate for creating and running schema migrations You can download and install the dependencies mentioned above using pip as:\n",
    "pip install SQLAlchemy\n",
    "pip install --upgrade pip\n",
    "pip install postgres\n",
    "pip install Flask\n",
    "pip install Flask-Migrate\n",
    "Note - If we do not mention the specific version of a package, then the default latest stable package will be installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Frontend Dependencies\n",
    "You must have the HTML, CSS, and Javascript with Bootstrap 3 for our website's frontend. If you are working locally, further instructions are contained in the repo README file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Install Bootstrap 3 for the website's frontend:\n",
    "\n",
    "npm init -y\n",

    "\n",
    "Models are located in the MODELS section of app.py.\n",
    "Controllers are also located in app.py.\n",
    "The web frontend is located in templates/, which builds static assets deployed to the web server at static/.\n",
    "Web forms for creating data are located in form.py\n",
    "Highlight folders:\n",
    "\n",
    "templates/pages -- (Already complete.) Defines the pages that are rendered to the site. These templates render views based on data passed into the template’s view, in the controllers defined in app.py. These pages successfully represent the data to the user, and are already defined for you.\n",
    "templates/layouts -- (Already complete.) Defines the layout that a page can be contained in to define footer and header code for a given page.\n",
    "templates/forms -- (Already complete.) Defines the forms used to create new artists, shows, and venues.\n",
    "app.py -- (Missing functionality.) Defines routes that match the user’s URL, and controllers which handle data and renders views to the user. This is the main file you will be working on to connect to and manipulate the database and render views with data to the user, based on the URL.\n",
    "Models in app.py -- (Missing functionality.) Defines the data models that set up the database tables.\n",
    "config.py -- (Missing functionality.) Stores configuration variables and instructions, separate from the main application code. This is where you will need to connect to the database.\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "Understand the Project Structure (explained above) and where important files are located.\n",
    "Build and run local development following the Development Setup steps below.\n",
    "Fill in the missing functionality in this application: this application currently pulls in fake data and needs to now connect to a real database and talk to a real backend.\n",
    "Fill out every TODO section throughout the codebase. We suggest going in order of the following:\n",
    "Connect to a database in config.py. A project submission that uses a local database connection is fine. For a refresher on setting up Postgres and connecting databases, refer to the SQLAlchemy Basics lesson. When working in the project classroom, the default user is postgres , there is no password, localhost is 127.0.0.0 and the default port for database connections is 5432.\n",
    "Using SQLAlchemy, set up normalized models for the objects we support in our web app in the Models section of app.py. Check out the sample pages provided at /artists/1, /venues/1, and /shows for examples of the data we want to model, using all of the learned best practices in database schema design. Implement missing model properties and relationships using database migrations via Flask-Migrate.\n",
    "Implement form submissions for creating new Venues, Artists, and Shows. There should be proper constraints, powering the /create endpoints that serve the create form templates, to avoid duplicate or nonsensical form submissions. Submitting a form should create proper new records in the database.\n",
    "Implement the controllers for listing venues, artists, and shows. Note the structure of the mock data used. We want to keep the structure of the mock data.\n",
    "Implement search, powering the /search endpoints that serve the application's search functionalities.\n",
    "Serve venue and artist detail pages, powering the <venue|artist>/<id> endpoints that power the detail pages.\n",
    "Data Handling with Flask-WTF Forms\n",
    "The starter codes use an interactive form builder library called Flask-WTF. This library provides useful functionality, such as form validation and error handling. You can peruse the Show, Venue, and Artist form builders in forms.py file. The WTForms are instantiated in the app.py file. For example, in the create_shows() function, the Show form is instantiated from the command: form = ShowForm(). To manage the request from Flask-WTF form, each field from the form has a data attribute containing the value from user input. For example, to handle the venue_id data from the Venue form, you can use: show = Show(venue_id=form.venue_id.data), instead of using request.form['venue_id'].\n",
    "\n",
    "Acceptance Criteria\n",
    "The web app should be successfully connected to a PostgreSQL database. A local connection to a database on your local computer is fine.\n",
    "There should be no use of mock data throughout the app. The data structure of the mock data per controller should be kept unmodified when satisfied by real data.\n",
    "The application should behave just as before with mock data, but now uses real data from a real backend server, with real search functionality. For example:\n",
    "when a user submits a new artist record, the user should be able to see it populate in /artists, as well as search for the artist by name and have the search return results.\n",
    "I should be able to go to the URL /artist/<artist-id> to visit a particular artist’s page using a unique ID per artist and see real data about that particular artist.\n",
    "Venues should continue to be displayed in groups by city and state.\n",
    "Search should be allowed to be partial string matching and case-insensitive.\n",
    "Past shows versus Upcoming shows should be distinguished in Venue and Artist pages.\n",
    "A user should be able to click on the venue for an upcoming show on the Artist's page, and on that Venue's page, see the same show in the Venue Page's upcoming shows section.\n",
    "As a fellow developer on this application, I should be able to run flask db migrate, and have my local database (once set up and created) be populated with the right tables to run this application and have it interact with my local postgres server, serving the application's needs completely with real data I can seed my local database with.\n",
    "The models should be completed (see TODOs in the Models section of app.py) and model the objects used throughout Fyyur.\n",
    "Define the models in a different file to follow Separation of Concerns design principles. You can refactor the models to a new file, such as models.py.\n",
    "The right type of relationship and parent-child dynamics between models should be accurately identified and fit the needs of this particular application.\n",
    "The relationship between the models should be accurately configured, and referential integrity amongst the models should be preserved.\n",
    "flask db migrate should work, and populate my local Postgres database with properly configured tables for this application's objects, including proper columns, column data types, constraints, defaults, and relationships that completely satisfy the needs of this application. The proper type of relationship between venues, artists, and shows should be configured.\n",
    "Stand Out\n",
    "Looking to go above and beyond? This is the right section for you! Here are some challenges to make your submission stand out:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement artist availability. An artist can list available times that they can be booked. Restrict venues from being able to create shows with artists during a show time that is outside of their availability.\n",
    "Show Recent Listed Artists and Recently Listed Venues on the homepage, returning results for Artists and Venues sorting by newly created. Limit to the 10 most recently listed items.\n",
    "Implement Search Artists by City and State, and Search Venues by City and State. Searching by \"San Francisco, CA\" should return all artists or venues in San Francisco, CA.\n",
    "Best of luck with your final project! Fyyur depends on you!\n",
    "\n",
    "Development Setup\n",
    "If you choose to work locally, more detailed information regarding setup can be found in the README here. Working in the project workspace, follow the instructions below:\n",
    "\n",
